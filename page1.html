My CCA

<h1> St. John Brigade </h1>
<p class="hello"> My first CCA in secondary school, St. John Brigade </p>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/superman/images/f/f5/Krypton_-_Gods_and_Monsters.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160827172246" width="160" height="90"/>
<p class="bye"> I didn't expect myself to love this CCA as much as i do because I was in a performing arts CCA in primary school. But, I somehow ended up falling in love with this CCA and my squadmates are my best friends!</p>
<p class="cool"> In St. John Brigade, we do learn first aid, do hours of foot drills to practise discipline, and my favourite part, PT!</p>
<p class="ok"> Overall, I've enjoyed my time in St. John Brigade so far, and i look forward to making more memories!</p>
